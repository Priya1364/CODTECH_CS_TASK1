🛡️ CODTECH Task-1 — File Integrity Checker
📌 Description

This project is developed as part of the CODTECH Cyber Security Internship.
It is a File Integrity Checker that detects whether a file has been modified by calculating and comparing SHA-256 hash values.

File integrity checking is used in cyber security to detect:

Malware attacks

Unauthorized file changes

Data tampering

🎯 Objective

To ensure that files remain unchanged and to detect any unauthorized modification using cryptographic hashing.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

hashlib (SHA-256)

⚙️ How It Works

The user enters the file name

The program calculates its hash

The user modifies the file

The program recalculates the hash

If the hashes are different, the file is detected as modified

▶️ How to Run
python file_integrity.py


Enter the file name and follow the instructions.

✅ Output

If the file is changed, the program will display:

WARNING! File has been modified.

🎓 Internship Task

This project fulfills Task-1 of the CODTECH Cyber Security Internship Program.
